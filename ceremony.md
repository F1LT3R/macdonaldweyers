##3. Service of Approach

###3.1. Call to Worship
###3.2. Hymn or Solo

###3.3. Introduction

**Minister Adam Herndon:**

Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the presence of these witnesses, to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
 
Marriage is an honorable estate, instituted by God and signifying unto us the mystical union, which exists between Christ and his church; It is therefore not to be entered into unadvisedly, but reverently, discreetly, and in the fear of God. Into this holy estate these two persons come now to be joined. 

Alistair MacDonald and Amanda Weyers, I charge you both, as you stand here in the presence of God, to remember that faith in God, together with love and  loyalty alone will avail as the foundation of a happy home. If the solemn vows  which you are about to make are kept inviolate, and if you consistently endeavor to do the will of your Heavenly Father (and not just please yourselves) then your life will be full of joy, and the home which you are establishing today will abide in peace. No other human ties are more tender, no other vows more sacred than those, which you are about to assume.

Please be seated.

##4. Service of God's Word

###4.1. Scripture Readings

**Read by: "Karen Cunningham?"**

> "Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart. Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and men. Trust in the Lord with all Your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge him and he will make your paths straight." 
> **&mdash; _Proverbs 3:3-6_**

**Read by: "Timothy Larson?"**

> "As a prisoner for the Lord, then, I urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received. Be completely humble and gentle; be patient, bearing with one another in love. Make every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bond of peace. There is one body an done Spirit—just as you were called to one hope when you were called—one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and father of all, who is over all and through all and in all."
> **&mdash; _Ephesians 4:1-6_**

**Read by: "Third Reader?"**

> "If you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any fellowship with his spirit, if any tenderness and compassion, the make my joy complete by being like minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and purpose. Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also of the interest of others. Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus."
> **&mdash; _Philippians 2:3-5_**

"Let us close in a word of prayer for this couple."

Our gracious God, who alone knows the future, we now entrust Alistair and Amanda and all their hopes and dreams to you. Give them strength through all the stresses of life.  Give them wisdom and devotion in their life together, that each may be to the other a strength in need, a counselor in perplexity, a comfort in sorrow, a companion in joy, and a partner in love. 

Give them grace, when they hurt each other, to recognize and acknowledge their fault, and to seek each other’s forgiveness and Yours. Bestow on them, if it is your will, the gift and heritage of children, and the grace to bring them up to know you, to love you, and to serve you.

We ask you blessing upon their families who have been linked together by this marriage. May love, understanding, and happiness flow freely between them. We pray the you would grant all married persons who have witnessed these vows may find their own lives strengthened and their loyalties confirmed.

O loving God, receive us and our prayers on the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with You and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.

And now in the words that Jesus taught us, we are bold to pray:

> "Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; But deliver us from evil one. Amen."
