## Celebrations

# Around The World

It is a bit of a logistical puzzle trying to get all of the families and friends in one place at one time. Since we haven't yet mastered all of time and space, we've opted to host several different gatherings over the course of the next year.  And since you're reading this, that means one of these wonderful events will be just for you!

Park Street Church is the church we met at nearly a year and a half ago. Since our faith is an important part of who each of us are, having shaped and directed both of our lives in important ways, we want to use this celebration to honor that aspect of our lives. 


# England Receptions

We are planning to travel to England in November of 2015 to visit with Al's family and friends.  While there, we plan on having a couple of get together with both Al's Mum's and Al's Dad's sides of the family. We feel fortunate that we have so many loved ones to celebrate with, and we're looking forward to meeting and catching up with everyone soon.
